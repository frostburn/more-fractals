It seems that I keep rewriting the same fractal code every few years

## Mandelbulb
This repository features a somewhat fast and numerically stable implementation of 3D "power" operation in `power3d.py`.
It agrees with regular complex multiplication on the plane so a Mandelbulb style fractal built using it will feature a Mandelbrot in the middle.
